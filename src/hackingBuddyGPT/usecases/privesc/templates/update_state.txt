Your current list of known facts relevant for privilege escalation is:

${facts}

You executed the command '${cmd}' and retrieved the following result:

~~~ bash
${resp}
~~~

Create a new list of facts that unifies the current list of facts as well as new information from the executed command. Organize the facts into these categories:

1. SYSTEM INFO: OS, kernel, architecture, user, groups
2. PROMISING VECTORS: Vectors that might work (with priority: high/medium/low)
3. FAILED VECTORS: Approaches that have been tried and failed - DO NOT try these again
4. CREDENTIALS FOUND: Any passwords, keys, tokens discovered
5. NEXT STEPS: What to try next based on findings

Keep each fact concise (one line). Remove duplicate or outdated facts. Mark vectors as FAILED if they returned "Permission denied" or similar errors.
