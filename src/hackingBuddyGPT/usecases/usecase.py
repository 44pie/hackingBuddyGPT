    A UseCase is the combination of tools and capabilities to solve a specific problem.

    @configurable) as fields. Then they can be automatically injected from the command line / environment / .env
    parameters.

    All UseCases should inherit from this class, implement the run method, and be decorated with the @use_case decorator,
